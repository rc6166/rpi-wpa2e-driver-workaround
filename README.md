A workaround to fix WPA2 Enterprise connections on Raspberry Pi

Connecting to WPA2 Enterprise at my university broke on Raspberry Pi recently and I had a number of these devices to fix, so this is a little script to automate patching them. This is an implementation of the fixes outlined [in a Raspian forum thread](https://www.raspberrypi.org/forums/viewtopic.php?p=1530590), the only information on the issue I could find. It's not too complicated of a fix, but I had trouble finding anything about it so hopefully this will help someone else.
